## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Paper Trading Engine

Every user starts with a **$100,000 virtual balance**. Trades are executed via the `/api/trade` endpoint which validates the order (sufficient balance for buys, sufficient shares for sells), records a `Transaction` document, and updates the user's balance atomically.

### Cost Basis Calculation

Portfolio positions are built by replaying transactions in chronological order:

- **BUY**: increases quantity and total cost (weighted average accumulation)
- **SELL**: reduces total cost proportionally (`avgCost × quantitySold`)
- **Full close** (`quantity → 0`): the symbol is deleted from state entirely, so the next BUY starts with a fresh cost basis — no stale weighted averages from previous positions

### P&L Chart

The `/api/portfolio/equity` route replays all transactions sequentially, tracking cash and holdings state at each transaction.It computes portfolio equity at every step and returns a `{ date, pnl }` time series, rendered as a Recharts `LineChart` on the portfolio page.

### Watchlist Button

- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate state updates before server confirmation
- **Debouncing**: 300ms delay prevents rapid API calls
- **Two Modes**: Button (full width) and Icon (compact for tables)
- **Toast Feedback**: Success/error notifications

### Trade Modal

- **Symbol autocomplete**: Debounced `searchStocks` suggestions while typing, shown for both BUY and SELL modes (can be disabled per usage)
- **Live price fetch**: Debounced 500ms after symbol entry, shows current price and estimated total
- **MAX button**: In SELL mode, one click fills the quantity with the full number of shares held

### AI Portfolio Analytics Service

`lib/services/portfolioAnalytics.service.ts` computes a structured `PortfolioSnapshot` on demand:

| Metric                   | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `totalEquity`            | Cash + total market value of all positions                    |
| `totalReturnPct`         | Cumulative return since first trade                           |
| `annualisedReturn`       | Geometrically annualised return (252 trading days)            |
| `volatility`             | Annualised standard deviation of daily equity returns         |
| `sharpeRatio`            | `(annualisedReturn − 0.03) / volatility`                      |
| `sectorBreakdown`        | Per-sector allocation % (denominator: `totalEquity`)          |
| `concentrationRiskLevel` | `HIGH` (>40%), `MEDIUM` (>20%), or `LOW` for largest position |
| `topGainer` / `topLoser` | Best and worst performing positions by unrealised %           |
| `cashAllocationPct`      | Cash as a % of total equity                                   |

The snapshot is passed to `app/api/portfolio/ai-analysis/route.ts`, which constructs a structured prompt and calls **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** with `responseMimeType: "application/json"`. The response is validated and returned to the `AIPortfolioAnalysis` client component.

### Authentication Flow

- Page-level authentication in layouts (no redirects in server actions)
- Session management with Better Auth
- Graceful error handling for unauthenticated users

### Email System

- AI-generated personalized welcome messages
- Daily news summaries with watchlist-based content
- Responsive HTML templates
- Fallback to general market news

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Test database connection
npm run test:db

# Run linter
npm run lint
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import project to Vercel
3. Add all environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy

### Other Platforms

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## 🔒 Security & Limitations

### Security Features

- **Authentication**: Secure session-based auth with httpOnly cookies
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords encrypted using industry-standard algorithms
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data never committed to version control
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Next.js security measures
- **Input Validation**: React Hook Form validation on client and server
- **Rate Limiting**: Debounced API calls prevent abuse

### Known Limitations

- **Market Data**: Free Finnhub tier limits API calls (30 calls/second)
- **Real-time Updates**: Data refreshes on page load, not WebSocket streaming
- **Email Delivery**: Requires valid SMTP configuration; may hit rate limits
- **AI Generation**: Gemini API has usage quotas; fallback to templates provided
- **Historical Data**: Limited to current quotes; no extensive historical analysis
- **Production Scale**: Not optimized for high-concurrency enterprise use

### Recommendations for Production

- Implement API rate limiting middleware
- Add Redis caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Use WebSocket connections for real-time price updates
- Set up monitoring and error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Configure CDN for static assets
- Implement comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, e2e)
